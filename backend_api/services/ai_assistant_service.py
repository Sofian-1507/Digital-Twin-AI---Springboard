"""
services/ai_assistant_service.py — Grounded AI assistant with provider fallback.
Gemini is the primary provider; Groq (an OpenAI-compatible API, called via the
`openai` client pointed at Groq's base_url — no OpenAI account involved) is the
fallback if Gemini is unconfigured or a call to it fails.

Grounding: rather than recomputing digital_twin_state live (what
user_service.get_twin_context does for GET /users/me, which is expensive — several
analytics-engine calls — and appropriate there but wasteful on every chat turn),
this reads the already-loaded User document's cached profile/active_goals/
digital_twin_state directly. GET /users/me already keeps that snapshot reasonably
fresh (the frontend calls it on every app load), so no extra recompute is needed
here — matches the "engines compose, don't reimplement" convention without paying
for a live recompute per message.
