"""
tests/conftest.py — Registers Beanie's class-level query metadata (needed for
expressions like `User.email == value`) once for the whole test session, against a
lazily-created Motor client that is never actually connected to.

Motor clients are lazy: constructing one and calling init_beanie() against it only
registers local class metadata (document settings, index definitions, the
`Model.field` expression descriptors) — no network I/O happens unless a real query is
awaited against it. Every test still mocks out the actual I/O calls (.find/.find_one/
.insert/.get/.aggregate/get_motor_collection) individually, exactly as before; this
fixture only makes `Model.field == value`-style expressions resolve instead of raising
AttributeError, which several service functions (create_user, authenticate_user,
delete_user, etc.) use internally.
