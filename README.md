# Digital Twin AI

A full-stack personal life dashboard that tracks finance, study, and daily habits, then layers analytics and forward-looking predictions on top of that data. Built with **FastAPI** + **MongoDB Atlas** on the backend and **React (Vite) + Tailwind CSS v4** on the frontend.

Everything but `README.md` and `CLAUDE.md` lives in [`docs/`](docs/), which has its own
[index](docs/README.md). Those two stay at the root because that is where a new contributor and
the tooling look for them.

`docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` is a forward-looking plan derived from an engineering design review.
Two parts of it have since been built — the staging database (Phase 0.1) and the goal-completion
model (Model 2, all three steps), with a second model (habit failure) added beyond it. Everything
else in it is unbuilt, and is marked as such. Treat the code and the other documents as the
authority on how the system behaves today.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 20+
- Python 3.10+
- A MongoDB Atlas cluster (or local MongoDB 7.0+)

### 0. Environment variables (shared)

Both apps read from a **single `.env` at the repo root** — copy the template and fill in real values:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

```env
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster>.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority
MONGODB_DB_NAME=digital_twin_ai_prod
JWT_SECRET_KEY=<a-securely-generated-secret>
VITE_API_URL=/api/v1
# Optional — AI assistant (Gemini primary, Groq fallback)
GEMINI_API_KEY=
GROQ_API_KEY=
```

`backend_api/core/config.py` resolves this file's path relative to its own location, and `frontend/vite.config.js` sets `envDir` to the repo root — so this works regardless of which directory you run either app from. There's no per-app `.env`/`.env.example` anymore; only `VITE_`-prefixed vars ever reach client-side code, so backend secrets stay server-only even though the file is shared.

### Staging vs. production data

`MONGODB_DB_NAME` selects the database. It currently defaults to `digital_twin_ai_prod`, so a
**missing** env var fails *toward* production rather than away from it — set it explicitly.

Scripts that delete or overwrite data (`scripts/seed_zohaib.py`, and any future backfill) call
`core/db_guard.py`'s `require_non_production()` before touching the database. It refuses to run
when `NODE_ENV=production` or when the database name contains `prod` / `production` / `live`:

```bash
# Blocked — refuses and explains why
python3 scripts/seed_zohaib.py

# Intended usage: point at a throwaway/staging database first
MONGODB_DB_NAME=digital_twin_ai_staging python3 scripts/seed_zohaib.py

# Deliberate production run — must name the database exactly, and prints a warning
DESTRUCTIVE_WRITE_ALLOW_DB=digital_twin_ai_prod python3 scripts/seed_zohaib.py
```

**Setting up staging** (one-time, and a prerequisite for the work in `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`):

1. Create a second database on the existing Atlas cluster — or better, a separate free-tier
   cluster, so a mistake cannot touch production at all.
2. Point `MONGODB_DB_NAME` (and `MONGODB_URI`, if a separate cluster) at it.
3. Seed it: `MONGODB_DB_NAME=digital_twin_ai_staging python3 scripts/seed_zohaib.py`
4. **Verify a restore actually works** before relying on it — an untested backup is not a backup.

Until step 4 is done, treat every migration as unrehearsed and irreversible.

### 1. Backend (FastAPI)

```bash
cd backend_api
pip install -r requirements.txt
export PYTHONPATH=$(pwd)
python3 -m uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

- API docs: `http://localhost:8000/api/docs`

### 2. Frontend (React + Vite)

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

- App: `http://localhost:5173`

### 3. Deployment (one image, one origin)

Frontend and API are deployed as **one origin**, not two services behind CORS —
this is the deployment topology this project has settled on, and it's not
incidental. The httpOnly auth cookie is `SameSite=Lax`; a Lax cookie is not sent
on a cross-site request, so a frontend and backend on different domains (a
Vercel frontend calling a Render backend, the common free-tier split) would
silently 401 every authenticated call. `vite.config.js` already proxies `/api`
to the backend in development for exactly this reason — same-origin deploy just
extends that same shape to production. See `docs/TEST_PLAN.md` Phase 0.1 for
the full reasoning, and Phase 0's checklist for what was verified rather than
assumed.

```bash
docker build -t digital-twin-ai .
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 --env-file .env -e NODE_ENV=production digital-twin-ai
```

What the image does, in three stages (see `Dockerfile` for the full commentary):

1. **Builds the frontend** — no `VITE_API_URL` is set; the same-origin deploy
   means its relative `/api/v1` default (`frontend/src/services/api.js`) is
   already correct, so there's no build-time secret to pass in.
2. **Trains the goal-completion model** — `backend_api/models_store/` is
   gitignored on purpose (deterministic under `--seed`, so regenerated rather
   than committed, same convention as `backend_api/data/`). The build runs
   `generate_synthetic_users.py` then `train_goal_model.py` so the image always
   ships with a real, working model rather than depending on someone having a
   binary checked out locally.
3. **Assembles a slim runtime image** from both stages' outputs — no Node,
   pandas, or matplotlib in the final image, and `main.py` serves the built
   frontend directly (`StaticFiles` + an SPA fallback) whenever
   `frontend/dist` is present, so the same `main.py` runs unchanged in local
   dev (`--reload`, no build present) and in the container.

**No secrets are ever baked into the image** — `.dockerignore` excludes `.env`
explicitly. `MONGODB_URI`, `JWT_SECRET_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `GROQ_API_KEY`,
and `NODE_ENV=production` all reach the container via `--env-file` (or your
platform's own env-var mechanism) at *run* time.

**`NODE_ENV=production` is the one variable that matters most** — it hides
`/api/docs`/`/api/redoc`, engages `require_non_production()`'s guard on
destructive scripts, and (as of this project's Phase 0 pass) now also flips
`COOKIE_SECURE` on by default, so the auth cookie ships with `Secure` without
that needing to be remembered as a second, separate variable. All three are
covered by `backend_api/tests/test_config.py` and were verified against a real
built container, not just read from the code.

**Single instance, single worker, by design** (`Dockerfile`'s `CMD`) — the rate
limiter (`core/rate_limit.py`) keeps its counters in-process, so more workers
or more instances silently divides `/auth/login`'s protection by however many
there are. Raise the worker/instance count only alongside moving the limiter to
shared storage (Redis-backed slowapi storage, for instance) — not before.

## Features

- **Auth** — JWT issued as an **httpOnly cookie** (not readable by frontend JS), carrying a token-version claim so logout and password-change invalidate every previously issued token at once. Axios sends it via `withCredentials`, retries idempotent GETs on transient failures, and redirects to `/login` on 401 — except on public routes, which must stay reachable while logged out.
- **Finance** — income/expense/savings tracking, category breakdowns, and savings-goal progress.
- **Study** — session logging, weekly study-hours chart, subject performance breakdown.
- **Habits** — daily sleep/water/exercise/screen-time logging with weekly habit-score trend.
- **Analytics** — productivity score, focus score, consistency score, and completion-percentage engines that power the dashboards.
- **Prediction** — trend-based forecasts for savings, study, and fitness scores, and a scenario simulator. Forecasts auto-select a method from how much history exists (`insufficient_data` → `naive_last_value` → `moving_average` → `linear_regression`) and report which one was used.
- **Goal-completion model** — a trained classifier estimating the probability a goal is met by its deadline. See [Machine learning](#machine-learning) below.
- **Assistant** — grounded chat over the user's own profile, goals and twin state, using Gemini with a Groq fallback. Rate-limited, since LLM calls cost quota.
- **Activity** — a unified audit log of create/update/delete actions across the app.
- **Dark mode** — a manual toggle (stored in user preferences), applied consistently across the whole UI via a `data-theme` attribute.
- **Design system** — "Studio": a warm-paper visual identity (Fraunces display serif, Inter body, JetBrains Mono for every number) defined as design tokens in `frontend/src/index.css`, so it cascades to every page and component with no per-file styling. See `docs/SKILLS.md` for the design-review workflow this was built through.

## Machine learning

A classifier estimating the probability that an active goal is completed by its `target_date`.

```bash
cd backend_api
python3 scripts/generate_synthetic_users.py   # training data
python3 scripts/train_goal_model.py           # train, evaluate, save artifact
```

Writes `data/model_eval/evaluation.png` (reliability diagram + coefficients),
`data/model_eval/metrics.json`, and `models_store/goal_completion.joblib`, which
`services/goal_completion_service.py` loads to serve `GET /users/me/goals/predictions`.
All three are gitignored and regenerate deterministically from the seed.

**Results** — logistic regression, held out by *user* rather than by row, since goals from one
person share that person's habits and a random row split leaks:

| | Accuracy | Lift over baseline | AUC | Brier | ECE |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Base rate | 52.1% | — | 0.500 | 0.254 | 0.066 |
| **Logistic regression** | **83.7%** | **+31.6pp** | **0.939** | **0.105** | **0.069** |
| Gradient boosting | 84.7% | +32.6pp | 0.918 | 0.128 | 0.109 |

Logistic regression ships despite the marginally lower accuracy: the output is shown to a user as
a probability, so calibration matters more than whether it lands on the right side of 0.5, and its
expected calibration error is substantially better (0.069 vs 0.109, against a target of < 0.10).

Numbers regenerate from the seed, so re-run both scripts if you change the generator — and
re-check this table, since it is written by hand.

Two deliberate constraints:

- **It refuses rather than guessing.** Goals with too little history, or whose inputs fall outside
  the range the model was trained on, return a reason instead of a number. A linear model
  extrapolates past its training range silently and confidently — it returned 99.8% for a real goal
  before this guard existed.
- **It is trained on synthetic data.** Good numbers here demonstrate the pipeline is correct — the
  model recovers signal that genuinely exists, is calibrated, and beats a baseline. They do **not**
  establish that it predicts real human behaviour. Only real longitudinal data can.

## Maintenance scripts

All live in `backend_api/scripts/` and are dry-run by default where they change data.

| Script | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `backup_restore_drill.py` | Dumps the database, restores it into a scratch copy, and compares per-collection counts. Atlas M0 has no automated backup, so this *is* the backup strategy — and an untested backup is not a backup. |
| `cleanup_test_accounts.py` | Removes accounts left by tests and QA. Deletion is opt-in by pattern, so an unrecognised address is always kept. `--orphans` finds records whose user no longer exists. |
| `fix_legacy_goal_ids.py` | Repairs `ObjectId` values in fields the models declare as `str` — Beanie cannot parse those documents at all, so the affected account 500s. |
| `backtest_forecast_accuracy.py` | Walk-forward accuracy check for the finance forecast. |
| `benchmark_simulation.py` | Latency check for the scenario simulator. |
| `seed_zohaib.py` | Rebuilds the demo account's data. **Destructive** — guarded. |
