# Dockerfile — one image, one origin.
#
# Three stages: build the frontend, train the goal-completion model, then
# assemble a slim runtime image from the outputs of both. The runtime stage
# never installs Node, pandas, or matplotlib — those only exist in the build
# stages and are discarded with them.
#
# See docs/TEST_PLAN.md Phase 0.1 for why this is one image rather than two
# services behind CORS: FastAPI serves the built frontend itself (main.py's
# "Frontend (same-origin deploy)" block), so the browser never sees the API
# call as cross-site and the httpOnly cookie's SameSite=Lax just works — the
# same reason vite.config.js proxies /api in development.


# ─── Stage 1: frontend build ───────────────────────────────────────────────
# No VITE_API_URL is set here, deliberately — the same-origin deploy means the
# frontend's relative "/api/v1" default (src/services/api.js) is already
# correct, so there is no build-time secret or config to pass in.

# ─── Stage 2: train the goal-completion model ──────────────────────────────
# backend_api/models_store/ is gitignored on purpose (see .gitignore's comment:
# "deterministic under --seed, so regenerate rather than commit"), matching how
# backend_api/data/ is already treated. Both generator and trainer default to a
# fixed --seed, so this reproduces the same artifact on every build rather than
# depending on a binary someone remembered to commit.
#
# Both scripts are fully standalone (no import from the app's own models/
# services/schemas) — confirmed by reading them — so only scripts/ needs to be
# present here, not the rest of the backend.

# moving the limiter to shared storage, not before.
