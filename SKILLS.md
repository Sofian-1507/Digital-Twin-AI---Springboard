# SKILLS.md

How UI/UX work in this repo goes through Claude Code design skills — `apple-design-skill` and,
for full design-system work (new palette/type/token direction, not a targeted fix), `ui-ux-pro-max`.
See `CLAUDE.md` for general repo conventions — this file is specifically about the design-review
workflow.

## What they are

`apple-design-skill` reviews and improves UI against Apple's Human Interface Guidelines, translated
into platform-agnostic principles (this is a React/Tailwind web app, not a native Apple platform —
the skill maps HIG concepts like "control size" and "system colors" onto their web/CSS equivalents).
It's invoked with `/apple-design-skill` and grounds every finding in a specific guideline reference
(`references/hig/*.md`) rather than opinion, so recommendations come with a citeable "why," not just
a "this looks off."

`ui-ux-pro-max` is a dataset-driven skill (`~/.claude/skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py`) for
generating or comparing whole design directions — typography pairings, color palettes by product
category, spacing/density presets — searched by `--domain` (color/typography/style/ux/chart/...) or
combined into a full `--design-system` recommendation for a given product category. Used on this
project for the ground-up "Studio" redesign (see below): it supplied the candidate typography
pairings and the `data-dense-dashboard` category's density/radius defaults, cross-checked against
`apple-design-skill`'s HIG contrast/dark-mode/layout guidance rather than either skill's output being
trusted alone. **Retry once with a narrower query if a result looks off-category** — the dataset
search can misfire on a broad first query (it returned a landing-page pattern and a handwritten font
pairing for a data-dashboard query once, corrected by re-querying with an explicit `--domain`).

## The workflow used on this project

Design work here follows a four-step cycle, each a separate, explicit request — the skill does not
jump straight to editing code on its own:

1. **Audit** (`/apple-design-skill "do a design audit..."`) — read-only review of pages/components
   against the skill's priority order (Accessibility → Platform Conventions → Visual Design →
   Interaction Design → Content), producing a severity-ranked Design Review Report. No files are
   touched.
2. **Visualize** ("generate an artifact, don't code anything") — when a proposed redesign is large
   enough to want sign-off before touching the real app, it gets mocked up as a static HTML
   Artifact first (see the `artifact-design` skill) using the app's real palette/type tokens, not
   the live components. Nothing in `frontend/` changes at this step either.
3. **Plan** ("generate an implementation plan, don't code anything") — once a direction is
   approved, the fixes get written up as a concrete, file-by-file plan (via Claude Code's plan
   mode) before any edit happens, so the scope of a "fix everything" request is explicit and
   reviewable up front.
4. **Implement** — only after the plan is approved does code change, followed immediately by
   `npx eslint .` and `npx vite build` (see `CLAUDE.md`'s frontend commands) plus a grep sweep
   confirming the specific bug patterns from the audit are actually gone, not just "probably fixed."

Skipping straight from a vague request to code changes has not been how this has worked — every
nontrivial visual change in this repo's history went through at least the audit step first.

## What the audits check for, concretely

These are the actual standards this repo's UI is held to, established by prior audit rounds:

- **Contrast**: every text/background pairing needs ≥4.5:1 (sub-18px text) or ≥3:1 (18px+/bold) —
  checked with real computed WCAG ratios against the actual hex values in `index.css`'s `@theme`
  block, not eyeballed.
- **Touch/click targets**: interactive controls need a real hit area (~28×28px minimum on desktop,
  44×44px default) — a small icon is fine, but its clickable padding must be sized independently of
  the icon's visual size (`p-0` around a 14px icon is a recurring bug class to watch for).
- **Keyboard operability**: anything a mouse can do, a keyboard must also be able to do — this is
  why the sidebar moved off hover-only expand and the custom `Select` component gained arrow-key
  navigation.
- **Dark-mode parity**: every color decision gets checked in both themes, not just light mode.
- **Consistency across pages**: shared components (`EmptyState`, `Skeleton`, `Card`, `Badge`, the
  Login/Signup/Forgot-Password auth shell) should look and behave identically everywhere they're
  used — a page that missed a shared redesign is treated as a bug, not a style choice.

## Where the current design system lives

- Color/radius/shadow tokens: `frontend/src/index.css`'s `@theme` block (the "Studio" warm-paper
  system — Fraunces + Inter + JetBrains Mono, teal accent, soft two-layer shadows — see the inline
  comments there for the rationale behind each override). This superseded the earlier "Field Notes"
  system in a full ground-up redesign; `frontend/design.md` still describes Field Notes and has not
  been rewritten for Studio yet — treat it as historical until it's updated.
- Shared primitives: `frontend/src/components/ui/` (per `CLAUDE.md`'s Frontend conventions).
- Chart colors: `frontend/src/utils/chartColors.js` — kept in sync with `index.css` **by hand**
  since Recharts/Plotly take literal hex values, not Tailwind classes. If a token in `index.css`
  changes, check this file too — an audit has already caught it drifting out of sync once. Also
  check for literal font-family strings passed to non-Recharts chart libs (e.g. Plotly's `layout.font`
  in `ScenarioExplorer.jsx`) — those don't inherit `@theme` either and were previously caught stale.

## Lesson from the Studio redesign: verify a token's *every* usage before recoloring it

The color ramp is dual-purposed throughout this app — most Tailwind class names (`slate-300`,
`indigo-600`, etc.) serve more than one role depending on context, e.g. `border-slate-200` (a
light-mode border) vs. `dark:text-slate-200` (a dark-mode text color, used at dozens of call sites)
resolve through the **same token**. A mid-redesign mistake in this repo: assuming `slate-300` was
mostly a rarely-used "border-strong" token and repainting it as a mid-gray for a border-contrast fix,
without first grepping how it was actually used — it turned out to be the dominant dark-mode
secondary-text color across nearly every table/form/card in the app, and the new value would have
silently dropped dark-mode text contrast below WCAG AA. Caught before shipping by grepping every
`.jsx` usage of the class name first. **Before assigning a token a new value, grep for every class
name built on it (`slate-300`, `text-slate-300`, `dark:text-slate-300`, `border-slate-300`, ...)
across `.jsx` files — not just the usage you're trying to fix — and compute contrast for each
distinct role the grep turns up**, not only the one the change was originally aimed at.
